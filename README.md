# Forage-Virtual-Iternship-Project-2

This project from Forage was based on a fictional company called Social Buzz which is a social media company that emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.

The objective that Social Buzz has set for the data analytics team is to analyze their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the
largest aggregate popularity. 

The analytics team is tasked with:
- The creation of an up-to-date big data best practices presentation 
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL 
- Merging of sample data set tables
- Loading of sample data sets into sandbox database
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel

Main Datasets Analyzed:
- Reaction Types
- Reactions
- Content
- Content_data (Temp Table that I created to analyze columns from the dataset into one big table)

- Attached to repository is also our Tableau Visualization with our insights.
